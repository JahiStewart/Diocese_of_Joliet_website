Altogether, the report is worth 60 points. The actual tool you created is worth another 50 points and will be graded 
based on functionality (i.e. do the required features work), user interface (i.e. is it easy to use), reliability and 
robustness (is it buggy or does it work well), and code quality. Each of those are worth 10 points, so the app is worth 
40 points in total. The app plus report are worth a total of 100 points, and that is how your grade will be determined.


I will hold this in "escrow" so that when it comes time for you to apply for CPSC 49200, we'll talk and make sure you
 get enrolled in a section where you can use this as the basis of your grade.
