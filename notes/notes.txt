DATABASE NOTES
11/21/2023 
I migrated Ray's create.sql file into our schema.sql file. In order for it to work I changed 
a few things. First, sqlite does not use CREATE/DROP DATABASE, so I changed it to drop each individual
table. Second, sqlite datatypes include: null, integer, real, text, and blob, so I changed all of the 
varchars() char(), etc to an included datatype. Third, sqlite does not use ALTER TABLE statements, so
I placed each foreign key assignment inside its respective table. - Chris
